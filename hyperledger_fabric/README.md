# Hyperledger Fabric Playground

This project provides several useful Docker-Compose script to help quickly bootup a Hyperledger Fabric network, and do simple testing with deploy, invoke and query transactions.

Currently we support Hyperledger Fabric all releases from v0.6.0, 1.x to latest 2.x.

## Getting Started

### TLDR

```bash
$ export RELEASE=v2.4.0
```

```bash
$ cd ${RELEASE}; make setup test
```

More details are as below.

### Pick up a fabric version

Enter the subdir of specific version and setup, e.g.,

```bash
$ cd ${RELEASE} # select a fabric version
$ make setup download # Install docker/compose, and pull required images
```

### Quick Test

The following command will run the entire process (start a fabric network, create channel, test chaincode and stop it.) pass-through.

```bash
$ make test  # Test with default fabric RAFT mode
```

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) dashboard listens at [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) to track the network statistics.

### Test with more modes

In v2.x, only raft is supported.

In v1.4.x, solo and kafka are also supported.

```bash
$ HLF_MODE=raft make test # Bootup a fabric network with solo mode
```

## Detailed Steps

See [detailed steps](docs/steps.md)

## Specify Version Numbers

* `.env`: docker images tags, used by those docker-compose files;
* `scripts/variable.sh`: docker images tags and project versions, used by scripts;
